You are tasked with generating a single cybersecurity awareness tip for users.

Use ONLY the following format and nothing else. Do not include any explanation, greeting, comment, or additional text. Output ONLY one JSON object, like this:

{
  "title": "Your custom title here",
  "subtitle": "Your custom subtitle here"
}

Requirements:
- Do NOT reuse the provided examples.
- Create a new tip that follows the same tone and format.
- Your entire response must be a valid JSON object.
- There must be NOTHING before or after the JSON â€” the first character must be `{`, and the last character must be `}`.
