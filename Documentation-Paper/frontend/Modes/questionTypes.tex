\subsection{Question Types}
SeQG has \textbf{six question types implemented}, enhancing the user's gamified experience with a dynamic, entertaining
app. Each of these question types has been implemented with visual animations depending on the correctness of
the answer and each one of them has an explanation generated by the LLM in case the user answered incorrectly.
The six question types are:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \hyperref[qt:single]{\textbf{Single choice}}
    \item \hyperref[qt:multiple]{\textbf{Multiple choice}}
    \item \hyperref[qt:think]{\textbf{Think event}}
    \item \hyperref[qt:dad]{\textbf{Drag \& drop}}
    \item \hyperref[qt:sort]{\textbf{Sorting}}
    \item \hyperref[qt:line]{\textbf{Line-connect}}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Single choice}\label{qt:single}
In this question type, the user is offered \textbf{two possible solutions} and has to select the correct answer. Once they
touch on the desired answer, the correct answer will be highighted in green. If they have failed, an instant LLM explanation
will be fetched on the same screen for the user to learn:
