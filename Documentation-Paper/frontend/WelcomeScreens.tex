When the user scans the QR code with their device, a screen will appear allowing them to leave the 
session remotely without needing to interact directly with the public display. 
If the user chooses the private mode, a \textbf{session token} linked to the user's device is stored server-sided, preventing other 
user's from interfering with the same session.

If a user is already connected to the server, any subsequent user scanning the QR code will see 
a different screen on their device, informing them, that the \textbf{session is currently occupied}.
