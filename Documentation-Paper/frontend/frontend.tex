\chapter{Frontend}

The frontend is the core part for interaction between our PSUI and the user, which gives it little room for mistake, as we are dependent on the users interest.
When the user begins interacting with our front-end, everything sets up for a session dependent on the users choice.
Either guest or private mode can be selected.
If the guest mode is chosen then a non saving session will get started, where the user gets the experience answering questions,
genereted by our localy saved llm.
Reaching a state, where the user is pleased and does not want to continue answering questions anymore, the session can either be closed or a personal grading can be requested.
If previously private mode was chosen instead of guest mode, then the users efforts will be saved on server side, so return users can continue where they left of answering.
After terminating the session the next user can get in line and start answering questions.
