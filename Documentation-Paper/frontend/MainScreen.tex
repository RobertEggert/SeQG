When the system is offline, the display shows a static screen where \textbf{security tips and news} are 
dynamically fetched by the LLM. These messages, shown in Figure 2.1, are designed to catch usersâ€™ attention 
and encourage them to engage with \textbf{SeQG} and learn more about \textbf{cybersecurity}.

When a user approaches the display and taps the screen, \textbf{two mode characters} appear, each accompanied 
by a short explanation of their functionality, as to be seen in Figure 2.3.
