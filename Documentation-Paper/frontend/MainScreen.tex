\section{Navigation Screens}

Until a user approaches and interacts with the display \textbf{security tips} are getting dynamically fetched by the LLM and shown on the screen.
These messages, shown in Figure 2.1, are designed to catch user's attention and encourage them to engage with our \textbf{SeQG} and learn more about \textbf{cybersecurity}.
On touch interaction the user gets navigated to the \textbf{mode selection} screen.

The \textbf{mode selection} allows the user to choose between one of \textbf{two mode characters}, each accompanied 
with a short explanation of their functionality, as to be seen in Figure 2.3
