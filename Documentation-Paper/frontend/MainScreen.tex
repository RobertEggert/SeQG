When the system is offline, the display shows a static screen where \textbf{security tips and news} 
are dynamically fetched by the LLM. These messages are designed to catch usersâ€™ attention and encourage 
them to engage with \textbf{SeQG} and learn more about \textbf{cybersecurity}.
When a user approaches the display and taps the screen, two mode characters appear, each accompanied 
by a short explanation of their functionality.
