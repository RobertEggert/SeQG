\section{URL Routing}
For URL navigation, we decided to use file based routing, which is a common practice in modern web applications.
In our specific case, we used the TanStack Router library.
This approach allows us to modularize our application into clear and structured URLs.
We can clearly define which component is in use, when a certain URL is accessed, which makes the code better maintainable and more understandable.
