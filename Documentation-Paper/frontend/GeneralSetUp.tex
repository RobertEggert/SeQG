\section{General Setup}

The SeQG frontend is built as a modern web application, with React and TypeScript to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. 
It is structured in a way that supports scalability, clarity, and ease of development. 
The overall design of the application is split into smaller and reusable components. 
Each part of the interface, from full pages to small buttons, is organized on purpose. 
This simplifies maintenance and the navigation through the codebase over time.
Visually, the interface is designed using Material UI (MUI) this ensures everything looks consistent, works well across different devices and screen sizes. 
Buttons, layout elements, and interactive features follow the same design language. 
Altogether, the frontend setup ensures a fast, flexible and user-friendly experience, while keeping the system lightweight and efficient.
