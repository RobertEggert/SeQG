\chapter{Backend}

The backend is the silent core of the entire project, which makes it possible enabling connection between the user and front end.
As the user establishes a connection to the front end, the next Backend component is made active, namely the interaction between the front end and the LLM API
After a session, our backend then also covers the safe disconnection logic and resets everything to a clean state.
